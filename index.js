  # detect-browser

  This is a package that attempts to detect a browser vendor and version (in
  a semver compatible format) using a navigator useragent in a browser or
  `process.version` in node.

  ## Example Usage

  <<< examples/simple.js

  Or you can use a switch statement:

  <<< examples/switch.js

  ## Adding additional browser support

  The current list of browsers that can be detected by `detect-browser` is
  not exhaustive. If you have a browser that you would like to add support for
  then please submit a pull request with the implementation.

  Creating an acceptable implementation requires two things:

  1. A test demonstrating that the regular expression you have defined identifies
     your new browser correctly.  Examples of this can be found in the 
     `test/logic.js` file.

  2. Write the actual regex to the `lib/detectBrowser.js` file. In most cases adding
     the regex to the list of existing regexes will be suitable (if usage of `detect-brower`
     returns `undefined` for instance), but in some cases you might have to add it before
     an existing regex.  This would be true for a case where you have a browser that
     is a specialised variant of an existing browser but is identified as the
     non-specialised case.

  When writing the regular expression remember that you would write it containing a
  single [capturing group](https://regexone.com/lesson/capturing_groups) which
  captures the version number of the browser.
